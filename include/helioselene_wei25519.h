 * @brief Wei25519 bridge: ingest a Weierstrass-form x-coordinate as an F_p element.
 *
 * The caller's ed25519 library handles the Ed25519 -> Wei25519 coordinate transform.
 * This function validates the raw 32-byte x-coordinate as a canonical F_p element
 * (which is simultaneously a Selene scalar, due to the cycle property).
