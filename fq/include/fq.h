/**
 * @file fq.h
 * @brief Field element type for F_q where q = 2^255 - gamma (Crandall prime, gamma ~ 2^126).
 *
 * On 64-bit platforms: fq_fe is uint64_t[5] in radix-2^51 representation.
 * On 32-bit platforms: fq_fe is int32_t[10] in radix-2^25.5 (alternating 26/25-bit limbs).
 * Same layout as fp_fe, but reduction uses Crandall folding instead of the 2^255-19 shortcut.
