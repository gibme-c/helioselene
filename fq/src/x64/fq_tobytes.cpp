/*
 * Canonical reduction mod q = 2^255 - gamma, then serialize to 32 bytes LE.
 *
 * fq_fe is uint64_t[5] in radix-2^51. Follows the same pattern as fp_tobytes_x64:
 * 1. Carry chain with gamma fold to nearly canonicalize
 * 2. "Add gamma and check overflow" trick to fully canonicalize
 * 3. Pack 5×51 limbs into 32 little-endian bytes
 *
 * The "add gamma" trick: if t >= q, then t + gamma >= 2^255, so bit 255 is set
 * after carry propagation. We use the overflow bit to select between t and t-q.
 * Since t + gamma = t - q + 2^255, the lower 255 bits of (t + gamma) equal t - q.
